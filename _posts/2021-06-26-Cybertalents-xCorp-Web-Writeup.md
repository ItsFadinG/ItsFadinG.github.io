## **Solution**

It an easy challenge will make you encounter with a reflected XSS vulnerability.

First, you have a parameter called name which the only one in the page. we can add a random value and see where it reflects.

we notice here that our payload is reflected in an image attribute and also it missing a single quote.

What we can do here to trigger an XSS simply we can fix the tag and our own attribute.

like this:

```javascript
name=itsfading'onload(alert(0))
```

And we will get the flag once we trigger the alert.
